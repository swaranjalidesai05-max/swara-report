## Database Schema

### Users Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `username`: Unique username
- `email`: Unique email
- `password`: Hashed password
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### Events Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `title`: Event title
- `date`: Event date
- `venue`: Event venue
- `department`: Department name
- `description`: Event description
- `event_photo`: Path to event photo
- `attendance_photo`: Path to attendance sheet
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `created_by`: Foreign key to users table

### Reports Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `event_id`: Foreign key to events table
- `file_path`: Path to generated report file
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `created_by`: Foreign key to users table

## Important Notes

1. **Letterhead Template**: You must create the `college_letterhead.docx` file in the `word_templates/` folder before generating reports. The template should contain your college letterhead at the top.

2. **File Uploads**: 
   - Supported image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF
   - Maximum file size: 16MB
   - Files are stored in `static/event_photos/` and `static/attendance_photos/`

3. **Security**: 
   - Change the `secret_key` in `app.py` before deploying to production
   - Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's security utilities
   - File uploads are validated for type and size

4. **Session Management**: 
   - Users remain logged in until they click "Logout"
   - Session data is stored server-side

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Letterhead template not found"
**Solution**: Create a Word document named `college_letterhead.docx` in the `word_templates/` folder.

### Issue: Cannot upload images
**Solution**: 
- Check file format (JPG, PNG, GIF only)
- Ensure file size is under 16MB
- Verify folder permissions for `static/event_photos/` and `static/attendance_photos/`

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**: Delete `database.db` and restart the application. The database will be recreated automatically.

## Development

To modify the application:

1. **Changing Styles**: Edit `static/css/style.css`
2. **Modifying Templates**: Edit files in `templates/`
3. **Adding Features**: Modify `app.py` and add new routes
4. **Database Changes**: Update the `init_db()` function in `app.py`

## Viva/Project Explanation

### Key Concepts Explained

1. **Flask Framework**: Lightweight Python web framework for building web applications
2. **SQLite Database**: File-based database perfect for small to medium applications
3. **Session Management**: Flask sessions store user login state securely
4. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug (never stored in plain text)
5. **File Upload**: Secure file handling with validation and safe storage
6. **Word Generation**: python-docx library creates Word documents programmatically
7. **Template Inheritance**: Jinja2 templates use inheritance (base.html) for consistent layout

### Security Features

- Password hashing (Werkzeug security)
- Session-based authentication
- File upload validation
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection (Jinja2 auto-escaping)

### Design Patterns Used

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
- Template inheritance
- Decorator pattern (login_required)
- Separation of concerns (routes, database, templates)
