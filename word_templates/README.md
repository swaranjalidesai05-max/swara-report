# College Letterhead Template

## Instructions

To use the report generation feature, you need to create a Word document with your college letterhead.

### Steps:

1. Open Microsoft Word
2. Create a new document
3. Add your college letterhead at the top of the document. This typically includes:
   - College logo
   - College name
   - Address
   - Contact information
   - Any other official details

4. Format the letterhead as you want it to appear in reports
5. Save the document as `college_letterhead.docx` in this folder (`word_templates/`)

### Important Notes:

- The letterhead should be at the **top** of the document
- The report content will be automatically added **below** the letterhead
- Use standard Word formatting (fonts, colors, alignment)
- Keep the file size reasonable (under 5MB recommended)

### Placeholders

The report engine replaces the following placeholders in the document:

- **{{PO_SECTION}}** – Program Outcomes (selected items, bullet list)
- **{{PSO_SECTION}}** – Programme Specific Outcomes (selected PSO text)
- **{{SDG_SECTION}}** – Sustainable Development Goals Addressed (selected SDGs as "SDG1: No Poverty", etc., or "Not Applicable")

Add a section in your template for SDGs, for example:

```
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Addressed
{{SDG_SECTION}}
```

Use the same formatting (font, spacing) as the PO/PSO section so the report looks consistent.

### Example Structure:

```
[College Logo]
COLLEGE NAME
Address Line 1
Address Line 2
Phone: XXX-XXX-XXXX | Email: info@college.edu
_________________________________________________

[Report content will be added here automatically]
```

After creating and saving the template, the report generation system will use it automatically when generating event reports.
